# letters-extractors-kanjis

Used to extract information from Persona 5 Dialogues in Japanese.

Along with the python scripts there are also some files that i've extracted some info, like demofile3.txt, that contains the kanjis used in dialogues in the game ordered by most used to least used.

There are also some .txt's that contains phrases for some kanjis that i wanted to have. Basically, given an kanji, it searches in the dialogues all the phrases that have that kanji and write them in a specific file.


Use the count_letters.py to provide an url and write in a file the kanjis most used ordered from the most used to the least used.

Use the find_phrases_b_letter.py to provide an url and find phrases that contains a specific Kanji.
